    <p>
      Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a
      slight downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline -
      15% under sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing
      strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed.
