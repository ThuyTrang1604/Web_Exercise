    <p>
      The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like
      the C300-25 performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had
      disappointing years. We anticipate a stronger year in current year with
      the introduction of the C300-30 model - a great copier at a competitive
      price.
